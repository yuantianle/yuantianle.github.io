    - **Distributed OS:** 
        - distributes the resources of the computer system <u>across multiple computer</u> nodes;
        - <u>cooperates through a network</u> to improve the reliability and performance of the computer system.

    - **Embedded OS:** an operating system designed for devices with <u>small sizes, low power consumption, and high reliability</u>.

### **What are OS components?**

??? question "What are OS components?"

    - **Kernel:** the core part of the operating system, responsible for <u>managing computer hardware</u> and <u>providing basic functions</u> such as system calls.

    - **Process manager:** responsible for the <u>efficient operation</u> of the computer system, including:
        -  creating, deleting, scheduling, and managing processes.
