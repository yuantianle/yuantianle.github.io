Unfortunately, the article does not provide a clear numbering for the questions, but I can provide a list of 40 questions to get to know before an interview about operating systems. These questions cover a wide range of topics and will help you prepare for the interview:

1. What is an operating system?
2. What are the main functions of an operating system?
3. What is the difference between a process and a thread?
4. What are the different types of scheduling algorithms?
5. What is deadlock and how can it be avoided?
6. What is paging and segmentation in memory management?
7. What are the different types of operating systems?
8. Explain the concept of virtual memory.
9. What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?
10. What are semaphores and how are they used?
11. What is the difference between internal and external fragmentation?
12. What is the role of a dispatcher in an operating system?
13. Explain the concept of thrashing.
14. What is the difference between logical and physical address space?
15. How does the operating system handle file management?
16. What are the different file allocation methods?
17. Explain the concept of disk scheduling.
18. What is the difference between contiguous and non-contiguous memory allocation?
19. What are the different types of inter-process communication?
20. Explain the concepts of demand paging and page replacement.
21. What is the purpose of a system call?
22. What is the difference between hard and soft real-time systems?
23. What are the main components of a computer system?
24. What are the different process states?
25. What is the difference between swapping and paging?
26. Explain the concept of CPU scheduling.
27. What is the difference between a monolithic and microkernel architecture?
28. What are the key aspects of security in an operating system?
29. What is the role of a process control block (PCB)?
30. How does an operating system handle device management?
31. What are the differences between primary and secondary memory?
32. What is the purpose of a file system?
33. Explain the concept of cache memory.
34. What is a critical section and how can it be managed?
35. What is the difference between mutex and semaphore?
36. Explain the concepts of context switching and process synchronization.
37. What is a system call and how does it work?
38. What is the difference between kernel mode and user mode?
39. Explain the concept of RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks).
40. What is the role of an operating system in resource allocation?

Studying these questions and their answers will help you gain a strong understanding of operating systems and better prepare you for your interview.
