# **:octicons-browser-16: Mock**

## **Mock**

???+question "Mock?"

    `Mock` means "fake". The point of using `mock` is for `parallelize development`. When we want to **test** the **frontend**, if the **backend** is still in development, we can use a `mock server` or `mock data` for temporal use.

???+question "When use mock?"

    1. **Testing** (unit test, integration test).
    2. **Parallelize** work (frontend and backend).
    3. Develop without the **payment** ðŸ’°ðŸ’°ðŸ’° for real server responses and requests.

## **Mock Server**

???+note "Mock Server"
    
    **Definition:** *imitate* a real server by providing **realistic** mock <u>responses to requests</u>.

    **Properties:**
        
      - Same abstract interface/contract (e.g. REST API).
      - Not a real implementation.

## **Mock Object**

???+note "Mock Object"
    
    **Definition:** in OOP (object-oriented programming), `mock object` is a **simulated object** that **mimics the behavior** of real objects in controlled ways (e.g. Mock class, Mock struct).
