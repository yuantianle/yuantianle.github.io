# **`Docker Compose` and it's application** 

We have already touched `Docker Compose` from [Guidance](./Guidance/docker_compose.md). Now it is time to do some advance behaviors based on `Docker Compose`!

> `Docker Compose` is a way to handle more than one `DocKer Container`. That is setting communiation between `DocKer Container`s. In this section, we will iterate all the situation between Server and Host combination to finally reach the goal of `DocKer Container` communications.

## **1.  Server and client in the same Docker container**

## **2.  Server in Docker container, client on host**

## **3.  Server on host, client in Docker container**

## **4.  Server in Docker container, client in another Docker container**
