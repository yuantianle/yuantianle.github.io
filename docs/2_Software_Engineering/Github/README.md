# **:simple-git:{.e_swift} Git & :simple-github:{.e_github} Github**

>**Version control is important especially when we are collaborating with others for a big project. `Git` is one of the tools for version control. `GitHub` is a cloud service for uploading and storing repos you edit locally.**

### This section is split into below sections:

1. [Git theory](theory.md) for understanding Git essence (ðŸ’¯ Highly recommend reading first before using the command line). 

2. [Git commands](commands.md) for a start using Git commands.

3. [GitHub Action](action.md) for CI.

4. [GitHub Semantics Versioning](sematicsversion.md) for a convention.
