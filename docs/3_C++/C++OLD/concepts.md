# **:simple-cplusplus: OOP concepts**

> This material is for listing different OOP concepts

- [Inheritance]
- [Polymorphism]
- [Encapsulation]
- [Overloading]
- [Overriding]
- [Compile & Run time]
- [Abstract class]
- [Virtual function & Interface]
- [Static methods and variables]


### **Inheritance**

???+Note "Inheritance"

    A **mechanism** in OOP that allows `subclass`(derived class) to inherit properties and methods from a `parent class`(base class). And it can add new properties and methods or override the old class's methods

    * **Usage:** `Subclasses` can inherit **public** and **protected** members from the `parent class`, but NOT **private** members.

    * **Advantages:** `Inheritance` is an important way of **code reuse**. (for avoiding duplicates, organizing code structure, and improving code readability and maintainability).

### **Polymorphism**

???+Note "Polymorphism"

    The **ability** of different objects to respond to the same message in different ways.

    * **Usage:** method overloading, method overriding, interface implementation, and more. 

    * **Advantages:** Improve code flexibility and extensibility, reduce code repetition, and better adhere to the open-closed principle.
