Dispatch queue (from Prof. Will Braynen, OSU) \u2693\ufe0e 1\ufe0f\u20e3 What? \u2693\ufe0e A dispatch queue is an object-like structure that manages the tasks you submit to it. All dispatch queues are first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structures. Thus, the tasks you add to a queue are always started in the same order that they were added.\u201d (source: Apple documentation ). That\u2019s important. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 For? \u2693\ufe0e Well, it\u2019s a way to run multi-threaded code without using threads directly. It\u2019s not as low level as working with threads. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 Diff with threads? \u2693\ufe0e A dispatch queue can manage its own pool thread , etc, and ultimately the point of a dispatch queue is to keep track of what instruction to execute next while giving you a higher-level API instead of dealing with threads directly Whereas you can think of a thread as where instructions actually execute ; for example, a thread might have start , stop , and sleep methods. A thread is short for a thread of execution and is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically [but not always] a part of the operating system \u201d ( wikipedia ). II. Serial queue, Concurrent queue, Main dispatch queue and Thread \u2693\ufe0e \ud83e\udd0f Grammar and Properties \u2693\ufe0e The table below shows how to use the dispatch queue, and in what situation: DQueue type Grammar Properties Serial queue DispatchQueue(lablel:\"..\").sync/.async { \u2026 } Private, conccurrent Concurrent queue DispatchQueue(lablel:\"..\", attributes: .concurrent).sync/.async { \u2026 } Global, parallel Main dispatch queue DispatchQueue.main.sync { \u2026 } Global, conccurrent \ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Dispatch Queue v.s. Thread \u2693\ufe0e The table below concludes the relationship between: D.Queue type / Thread Main thread Other thread Task Processing Type Serial queue sync : main thread N/A N/A async : multiple threads [ serial ] [ concurrent ] Concurrent queue N/A multiple threads [ parallel ] Main dispatch queue main thread N/A [ serial ] Q&A If it is the first time your call let myQueue = DispatchQueue(label:\"test queue\") and sync , how many queues will app have for main thread? Which queue will tasks in sync code block be queuing? Two. One is main queue. Another one is private queue created by let myQueue = DispatchQueue(label:\"test queue\") . Tasks in sync code block will be queuing in the new created private queue. You can also feel the answer from the figure in \"No dead lock case (serial queue with sync)\" What queue will tasks in sync block be on? When you call let myQueue = DispatchQueue(label:\"test queue\") , you will send the code in the block of sync to some other queue besides existing queue (such as main queue). No matter in serial, concurrent or parallel processing, you can always have multiple queues (* but not for threads). What thread will tasks in sync block be on? Remember: Context-switching between threads is expensive. Cheaper to stay on the same thread if you can. Anytime you call sync , even if you do not do DispatchQueue.main.sync { \u2026 } (to send the work to the main dispatch queue) and instead synchronously dispatch to some other queue, even a private queue you created, the task you submitted might still execute on the main thread. What queue and thread will tasks in DispatchQueue.main.sync { \u2026 } block be on? Main queue. Main thread. Deadlock condition? Same thread & serial queue & sync ---> deadlock. III.

Edit Swift code and do testing Finally, let\u2019s see how I use the VS Code to edit Swift codes. Firstly, git fork the code from the repo ( https://github.com/oregon-state-innovation-lab/cs561-swift ). Then git clone the forked folder into your code folder in the terminal: Checkout to async-await branch: Open swift files by clicking the content on the left side directory: Text Only #### Try it now :point_down: Let\u2019s do the testing of the test folder: Check the code coverage llvm-cov report ... : 5. An updated way to do Swift code editing and testing \u2693\ufe0e I think you have found that using the extension in the Docker logo can not help us realize the full function of syntax highlighting and there is no autocomplete. Here I provide a way to furtherly realize the function of editing Swift code on VS Code. Rather than using the extension of the whale (squared by red), we are going to use the remote extension (squared by green) as shown above. Choose the Containers in the remote explorer: Right-click the image that is running and chooses Attach in New Window : In the new window, \ud83d\udcc2 Open Folders in the parent directory / (not the /root ), then Enter using your keyboard. Now you can see your files: We still cannot see the full highlight. Let\u2019s open the extension window in the remote interface. Click the Install in Container swiftlang/swift-nightly-focal (.....) button and install it in your container: Now you can see the variables that can show up in the extension. Also, click the Conical flask extension and run the Test codes: Here is the result (with variable detection, definition tracking, autocomplete, and testing): Nice nice!!!!
