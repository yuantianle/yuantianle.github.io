Intersection between a circle and a matrix is determined by checking if the circle's center lies within the matrix's boundaries and calculating the distance between them. Testing convex polygon intersection. Convex polygon intersection can be determined by checking if any edge of one polygon intersects with any edge of the other polygon. Accelerating ray-triangle intersection with spatial data structures. Acceleration structures like BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) or KD-tree can be used to efficiently determine ray-triangle intersections. SVD decomposition of a matrix. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) decomposes a matrix into three matrices, U, \u03a3, and V, where \u03a3 contains the singular values of the original matrix. Converting a nonlinear problem into a linear problem. Nonlinear problems can be linearized by approximating them with linear equations using techniques like Taylor series expansion. Estimating world coordinates from 2D screen coordinates with depth information. Using the depth value and a perspective transformation, the 2D screen coordinates can be transformed back into 3D world coordinates. Precision issues in deferred rendering and the use of depth versus direct world position. Deferred rendering stores position in view space, which loses precision. Depth is preferred for position reconstruction due to its better depth distribution. Storage space of normals in deferred rendering. Normals in deferred rendering are stored in view space, as view space normals don't suffer from interpolation issues. Incorporating Ambient Occlusion (AO) in deferred rendering. AO can be implemented by sampling the depth buffer and testing occlusion against nearby points to estimate shadowing. Performance comparison between deferred rendering and forward rendering when sampling depth maps. Deferred rendering performs better when sampling depth maps for shadowing, as it avoids redundant shading calculations. G-buffer components and formats. G-buffer typically consists of position, normal, color, and material information, stored in textures with various formats. Difference between depth and color texture samplers. Depth texture samplers use depth comparison for sampling, while color texture samplers perform linear filtering for color data. Unity's different rendering pipelines and their distinctions. Unity has pipelines like Built-in Render Pipeline, Universal Render Pipeline (URP), and High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), each catering to different needs. Detecting graphical glitches like screen tearing, artifacts, and black screens. Screen tearing occurs when frames aren't synchronized with the display. Artifacts can result from various rendering issues, and black screens can be caused by improper rendering or synchronization. Knowledge of various graphics APIs and their usage. Familiarity with DirectX, Vulkan, OpenGL, and Metal, including the version you've used. Overview of OpenGL's rendering pipeline. The OpenGL pipeline consists of stages like vertex shading, tessellation, geometry shading, fragment shading, and rasterization. Purpose of GLFW and its context. GLFW is a library for creating windows and OpenGL contexts. A context manages OpenGL's state and resources for rendering. Differences between OpenGL and OpenGL ES. OpenGL is a desktop graphics API, while OpenGL ES is a version optimized for embedded systems like mobile devices and game consoles. Types and purposes of frame buffers. Frame buffers store rendering results before they're displayed. They include color, depth, and stencil attachments. Role of the BufferData function in OpenGL. BufferData is used to allocate memory and initialize the contents of a buffer object in OpenGL. Differences between glFinish() and glFlush() in OpenGL. glFinish() blocks the CPU until all queued OpenGL commands are executed, while glFlush() only ensures that commands are sent to the GPU and may not wait for completion.</p>"},{"location":"10_Interview/Game_DevOP/CG_questions/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<ul> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li>Picture resource 2</li> <li>Picture resource 3</li> <li>Picture resource 4</li> <li>Picture resource 5</li> <li>Picture resource 6</li> <li>Picture resource 7</li> <li>Picture resource 8</li> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li>Picture resource 1</li> <li></li> </ul>"},{"location":"10_Interview/Game_DevOP/Coding_questions/","title":"\ud83c\udfae Coding Questions","text":"<p>This material is for related questions:</p> LSBbKioyRCBwbGFuZSBxdWVzdGlvbioqXSgjMmQtcGxhbmUtcXVlc3Rpb24pCi0gWyoqRGVzZ2luIGEgaGVybyoqXSgjZGVzZ2luLWEtaGVybykKLSBbKipOZXd0b24tUmFwaHNvbiBtZXRob2QqKl0oI25ld3Rvbi1yYXBoc29uLW1ldGhvZCk="},{"location":"10_Interview/Game_DevOP/Coding_questions/#2d-plane-question","title":"2D plane question","text":"In a 2D plane with multiple rectangles, how do you group them based on overlapping situations? <p>Answer: Treat this as a graph problem.

This made <code>coroutines</code> a very flexible tool for tasks like animations, timed events, or other frame-based operations.</p> Introducing of Awaitable in Unity <p>In Unity 2023.1+, the <code>Awaitable</code> class was introduced to provide a more efficient way to handle asynchronous operations. It allows developers to use <code>async/await</code> syntax in Unity and designed to optimize <code>async/await</code> patterns for Unity's game engine.</p> How to use <code>Awaitable</code>? <p> </p> Conclusion\uff1aFeatures of <code>Awaitable</code>? <ul> <li>the asynchronous calculation can be stopped     </li> <li>automatically deconstructed after completion      </li> <li>can switch between main thread and background threads     </li> <li>Task delay cannot be used in WebGL, but awaitable can     </li> <li>Awaitable objects are pooled and reused to avoid excessive memory allocations, which helps improve performance in environments like WebGL and mobile platforms\u200b</li> </ul>"},{"location":"11_Game_Development/Unity/Unity_Investigation/Awaitable/Awaitable/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<ul> <li>Awaitable Video</li> <li>Unity Awaitable Documentation</li> </ul>"},{"location":"11_Game_Development/Unity/Unity_Investigation/Unity_Debug/Unity_debug/","title":"Unity Debug","text":"<p>Here are several tools under the IDE for debugging the CPU and GPU.</p>"},{"location":"11_Game_Development/Unity/Unity_Investigation/Unity_Debug/Unity_debug/#memory-profiler","title":"Memory profiler","text":"When to use <code>Memory profiler</code>? <ul> <li>Monitors real-time memory usage for both managed and native memory.</li> <li>Identifies memory allocations and leaks to optimize RAM usage.</li> <li>Tracks memory allocation per object type, helping pinpoint areas of high memory consumption.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"11_Game_Development/Unity/Unity_Investigation/Unity_Debug/Unity_debug/#profiler","title":"Profiler:","text":"When to use <code>Profiler</code>? <ul> <li>Tracks CPU and GPU performance in terms of time spent on different tasks.</li> <li>Provides a breakdown of scripts, rendering, physics, and other processes.</li> <li>Identifies bottlenecks by showing frame time and resource usage.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"11_Game_Development/Unity/Unity_Investigation/Unity_Debug/Unity_debug/#frame-debugger","title":"Frame Debugger:","text":"When to use <code>Frame Debugger</code>? <ul> <li>Allows you to step through frames to visualize each draw call.</li> <li>Helps understand the order of operations in the rendering pipeline.</li> <li>Useful for debugging overdraw, incorrect rendering order, and other rendering issues.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"11_Game_Development/Unity/Unity_Investigation/Unity_Debug/Unity_debug/#rendering-debugger","title":"Rendering Debugger:","text":"When to use <code>Rendering Debugger</code>? <ul> <li>Focuses on specific stages of the GPU pipeline.</li> <li>Helps debug shader issues, pipeline state, and resource binding.</li> <li>Useful for troubleshooting rendering artifacts or GPU-related bugs.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"11_Game_Development/Unity/Unity_Investigation/Unity_Debug/Unity_debug/#rendering-graph-viewer","title":"Rendering Graph Viewer:","text":"When to use <code>Rendering Graph Viewer</code>? <ul> <li>Visualizes the rendering pipeline nodes.</li> <li>Shows how resources like textures, buffers, and shaders are used in each stage.</li> <li>Helps optimize resource allocation and GPU performance.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"11_Game_Development/Unity/Unity_Investigation/Unity_Debug/Unity_debug/#reference","title":"Reference","text":"<ul> <li>Memory Profiler overview</li> <li>Profiler overview</li> <li>Frame Debugger overview</li> <li>Rendering Debugger overview</li> <li>Render Graph Viewer</li> </ul>"},{"location":"11_Game_Development/Unity/Unity_Investigation/Unity_LifeCycle/Unity_LifeCycle/","title":"Unity Life Cycle","text":"<p>Here is the official documentation for Unity Life Cycle: </p> Simplification of Unity Life Cycle <p>The Unity Life Cycle can be simplified as follows:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>Awake: Called when the script instance is being loaded.</li> <li>OnEnable: Called when the object becomes enabled and active.</li> <li>Start: Called on the frame when a script is enabled just before any of the Update methods are called the first time.</li> <li>FixedUpdate: Called every fixed frame-rate frame.</li> <li>Update: Called every frame.</li> <li>LateUpdate: Called every frame after Update has finished.</li> <li>OnGUI: Called multiple times per frame.</li> <li>OnDisable: Called when the behaviour becomes disabled.</li> <li>OnDestroy: Called when the script instance is being destroyed.</li> </ul> <code>FixedUpdate</code> vs <code>Update</code> <ul> <li> <p>FixedUpdate: Use FixedUpdate when dealing with physics or other time-dependent operations.

Singular matrices do not have an inverse, meaning they are non-invertible. Non-singular matrices, on the other hand, have a non-zero determinant and possess an inverse.</p> </li> <li> <p>Volume Interpretation: For a 3x3 matrix, the determinant gives the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by its row or column vectors.
